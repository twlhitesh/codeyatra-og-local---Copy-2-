# Snowflake Data Migration Error Fixes

## Error Overview

Several errors were occurring in the Streamlit application due to missing or mismatched columns between the local CSV files and Snowflake database tables. These errors included:

1. **Population Data Errors**: 
   - "Required columns not found in population data. Please check the CSV format."
   - Missing Urban vs Rural Population data

2. **Cultural Heritage Errors**:
   - "UNESCO Status" column not found
   - "An error occurred: 'UNESCO Status'"

3. **State Comparison Errors**:
   - "Error in Population & Regions tab: 'HDI'"
   - Missing HDI (Human Development Index) data

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Columns to Snowflake Tables

We modified the `snowflake_setup.py` script to:

- Add a new `alter_tables()` function that adds missing columns to existing tables
- Add `HDI` column to the `STATES` table 
- Add `UNESCO_STATUS` column to the `CULTURAL_HERITAGE` table
- Add `URBAN_POPULATION_PCT` and `RURAL_POPULATION_PCT` columns to the `POPULATION_GROWTH` table

### 2. Enhanced Data Loading Functions

We updated the data loading functions in `modules/utils.py` to:

- Check for missing columns and add them with default values if not present
- Map column names correctly between Snowflake and the application
- Provide fallback data if certain columns are missing
- Add HDI data for all states with accurate values
- Ensure consistent column naming between local files and Snowflake

### 3. Updated Snowflake Data Upload

We improved the data upload process to:

- Add missing columns to dataframes before uploading to Snowflake
- Ensure column naming conventions are consistent
- Add default values for missing data
- Handle errors gracefully

## Testing and Verification

After implementing these fixes:

1. We ran `python snowflake_setup.py` to update the Snowflake tables with missing columns
2. We created an enhanced `test_snowflake.py` script to verify:
   - All tables exist in Snowflake
   - All required columns exist in each table
   - Sample data looks correct for each table
3. We ran the Streamlit app to confirm the errors are resolved

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Fallback Mechanism**: The application now tries to query Snowflake first, then falls back to local files if needed
2. **Error Tracking**: Added tracking of Snowflake errors to disable Snowflake after too many errors
3. **Data Validation**: Added validation for required columns with appropriate warnings
4. **Default Values**: Provided sensible defaults for missing data
5. **Documentation**: Created documentation of fixes for future reference

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement automated data validation before uploading to Snowflake
2. Add schema versioning to track changes to data structure
3. Consider adding a data migration tool for future schema changes
4. Implement automated testing for data consistency 

## Column Type Fixes (Added on Update)

Fixed the data types for the following columns in Snowflake:

- `ECONOMIC_IMPACT_MILLIONS_USD` changed to FLOAT type
- `PARTICIPANTS_MILLIONS` changed to FLOAT type
- `DURATION_DAYS` changed to INT type

These changes ensure that numeric calculations work correctly in visualizations.
