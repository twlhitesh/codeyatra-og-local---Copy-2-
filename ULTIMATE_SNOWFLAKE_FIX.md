# Ultimate Snowflake Column Naming Fix

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the errors across multiple pages of the application, we identified the fundamental issue causing the problems:

**Column naming inconsistency between local CSV files and Snowflake tables.**

Specific problems:

1. **Automatic uppercasing**: Snowflake automatically converts all column names to uppercase (e.g., `Name` becomes `NAME`)
2. **Special character handling**: Snowflake replaces special characters with underscores (e.g., `Religion/Type` becomes `RELIGION_TYPE`)
3. **Missing columns**: Some columns required by the application weren't present in the Snowflake tables
4. **Column type mismatches**: Data type differences between local and Snowflake storage

## Comprehensive Solution

We implemented a multi-layered solution to ensure proper data handling across all components:

### 1. Standardized Column Naming

Created a `standardize_column_names()` function in `snowflake_setup.py` that:
- Standardizes column names across all files before upload
- Adds missing columns based on file type
- Handles special characters consistently
- Provides default values for required columns

### 2. Table Alteration

Enhanced the `alter_tables()` function to:
- Add all missing columns to existing tables
- Support special cases like `CULTURAL_CONTRIBUTIONS` 
- Handle problematic columns like `RELIGION_TYPE`
- Add any columns that were missed in the initial setup

### 3. Enhanced Data Loading

Updated data loading functions in `utils.py` with:
- Complete column mapping between Snowflake and application
- Creation of new dataframes with properly mapped columns
- Default values for missing data
- Fallback data when queries fail

### 4. Robust Error Handling

Improved error handling throughout:
- Graceful fallback to local files when Snowflake fails
- Default minimal dataframes to prevent app crashes
- Helpful warning messages that don't block functionality
- Tracking of error frequency to disable problematic sources

## Special Case Handling

We implemented specific solutions for problematic fields:

### 1. Religion/Type in Festivals

- Renamed to `RELIGION_TYPE` in Snowflake
- Added explicit mapping in data loading functions
- Added a special column check in `alter_tables()`

### 2. Cultural Contributions

- Added `CULTURAL_CONTRIBUTIONS` column to Snowflake
- Provided default values for missing data
- Added proper mapping in the cultural data loading function

### 3. UNESCO Status

- Added `UNESCO_STATUS` column to Snowflake
- Implemented standard "Not Listed" default value
- Added to required columns list for validation

### 4. Urban/Rural Population

- Added percentage columns to population growth table
- Provided default percentages (35% urban, 65% rural)
- Added proper mapping in data loading

### 5. HDI (Human Development Index)

- Added to states table with accurate values for each state
- Implemented in both the standardization function and utils.py
- Added to required columns list for validation

## Testing and Verification

After implementing these fixes:

1. Ran `python snowflake_setup.py` to update all tables with standardized columns
2. Verified all required columns exist in the Snowflake tables
3. Confirmed data is loaded correctly and formatted appropriately
4. Tested all affected pages in the application

## Future-Proofing

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Column Registry**: Maintain a centralized registry of all column mappings
2. **Data Validation**: Add pre-upload validation to catch inconsistencies
3. **Schema Versioning**: Track schema changes and migrations
4. **Automated Testing**: Add tests for data consistency across sources

This comprehensive approach ensures that column names are handled consistently throughout the application, regardless of whether data is coming from local files or Snowflake.
